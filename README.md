# Patients

Sorry, I failed to accomplish a few features

 - i18n
 - many-to-many associations, aka Patients 2 Locations
 - MySQL adapter

This realease is v0.9.

You can see my development flow(alse development time) using `tig` or GUI versions of git.

Last Monday and Tuesday, I spent time studying using mustache and javascript to seperate frontend with backend, cause I don't want to learn one more template language and also keep html clean(which in ui/plan). I am sorry to interrupt to learn things not related to current story.
